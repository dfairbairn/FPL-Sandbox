# FPL Sandbox

A repository for various useful tools for doing data analysis pertaining to PL and FPL.

## Goals

I. Data access for PL data
 * API access
 * xG/xA data??
 * ???

II. Useful analyses for decisionmaking when it comes to FPL team composition
 * Use of basic stats (Fixture Difficulty Rating, Home/Away matches, Player/Team form) to predict promising upcoming choices
 * Incorporate xG/xA data. Create 'enhanced' stats (xP)
 * ???

III. Ambition: play with OpenCV to automatically track player positions from audience view of game.
 * Crapshoot in terms of quality, and audience view has limited FOV 
 * Still could be interesteding PoC

## Code
